There's a problem with some of the array design mappings - they're gone from Ensembl, which is bad because microarray experiments have results per probe and the probe to gene ID mappings keep changing.

Maria decides she doesn't want to wait until they made it back in and will run a script without these mappings, and backfill them from the archive.

She removes them temporarily, pushes to git and deploys (not sure how the deployment happened from the git repository)

The way to run the command is in a wiki. She sets up environment variables saying which Ensembl release it is now.
She pastes that command in - it's bsub which runs stuff on the cluster - she specifies where the log files should go. Then watches the results.

The script usually fails so she's gonna come back to wherever it failed last time to see if it progressed yet.



We keep our own versions of Perl and R, making sure it's up to date and so on, because systems don't do that very well. The shortcuts are set up in ~/.profile of fg_atlas.
Our perl is aliased to somewhere on NFS, that's shared, ~/.profile is shared, and we can ask the cluster for the same machine as fg_atlas which is super nice.
We can alias amm in exactly the same way, probably also telling it to keep its class files in /var/tmp.
